			<h4>What went right and what went wrong</h4>

			<p>By the end of the 3 days, we did have some measure of a functional system,
			but many aspects of it were still not satisfactory. Lets see what
			our system managed to do: </p>

			<li>Rotate using computer control</li>
			<li>Rev up the flywheel to a variable speed</li>
			<li>Launch the glider over a distance</li>

			<p>Despite the above, the mechanisms to perform each individual task all
			suffered from some issue or another. For starters, the rotator mechanism we
			employed suffered from an astounding lack of stability, and the turret assmebly
			(ie. the business part of the system) kept falling over when the command
			was sent to rotate it. The rotator base itself was based of the 'ball bearing adaptor'
			that we 3D printed, and then repurposed after we found the bearing to be redundant.</p>

			<p>Another issue was the motor power draw. When we (Hans) tested the motors at home
			the motor speed was very high and satisfactory. The test was made with the
			corresponding interface circuitry (ie. the transistors etc.). The results of
			the test showed us that the drive system was performing to spec. However,
			upon actual use with the PSU, it was found that the	motor current draw started
			to choke. The current draw during testing at home was about 1 Amp per motor.
			This had dropped to an embarassing 0.3 amp with the PSU. What was once a credible
			launching system now looked more like a pre school toy with the abysmal motor speed.
			We had to try changing out certain key components, like transistors, as well as
			lowering the value of our resistors. Fortunately, we had help from some of
			our seniors in the rewiring, which freed up valuable time to troubleshoot the
			other components.</p>

			<p>Finally there was the launcher itself. The cardboard cut out structure was
			in itself very rough and contributed to alot of friction, making it inefficient.
			This itself would have been tolerable if the launching speeds were high enough.
			Unfortunately due to the above, this was not the case and the friction penalty
			incurred was sufficient to severely limit the range of the launch, to about a meter
			at best</p>

			<h4><br>Improvements?</h4>

			<p>The single most glaring fix we could perform is to rebuild the turret
			assembly using laser cut acrylic. This would reduce the friction experienced
			during launch significantly. Also, based on the designs of others, we would
			probably increase the depth of the channel where the paper plane sits in.
			Not only would this allow for a plane with a deeper base, this will also reduce
			friction during the launch, as the base of the plane wont scrape against the base
			of the assembly.</p>

			<p>The next thing on the list would be the rotator. The quickest solution to
			prevent the turret assembly from falling over would be to slow the speed of
			the servo rotation. While this might work, it dosent look as cool as when the
			servo just swings 90 degrees at full speed, so lets examine other possible alternatives.
			We would probably need a more secure way to mount the base plate of the turret
			to the servo. The contact area was too small to prevent the thing from just
			popping off. Ideally we would have a larger servo horn.
			Alternatively, we could have the servo drive the rotator plate remotely, through
			a long rod, while the rotator plate sits on a decently sized ball bearing.</p>

			<p>Finally, it is a little disappointing to say that we are still unable to
			identify what is causing the low motor current draw. Nonetheless, we do
			have a stopgap solution provided to us by our lecturers. This was to increase
			the voltage accross the motor and 'force' an increased draw in current, which
			allowed it to spin faster. In the actual event, this was employed and we
			barely got the plane to launch. Consequently, we also had to provide
			the servo supply rail with its own seperate 5V power source, lest it would
			have shorted our poor servo out.</p>
